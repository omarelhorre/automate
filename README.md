Hello, This is a C automate project which allows you to identify whether a wword belongs to a language or not... 
OS : debian
Carefully read this:
the header.h contains prototype of functions and the header.c contains the functions themseleves used along this project, finally the main.c includes the header in order to invoke the header.c functions.
the makefile makes life easier ;) instead of running gcc -o main main.c ... you can just run the following commands: 
>make automate
>./automate
